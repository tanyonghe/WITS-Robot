# Interactive Robot Tracking System

### The best interactive robot companion for your children.

## The Problem
There is lack of motivation for children to exercise especially if children suffering from cerebral palsy experience discomfort, pain, or laziness.

## Our Target
We plan to target children below the age of 12 who are suffering from mild to moderate conditions of cerebral palsy.

## Our Purpose
We hope to encourage children suffering from cerebral palsy to move around and exercise more in order to prevent muscular atrophy and strengthen their muscles instead, therefore mitigating the effects of their cerebral palsy condition.

## Our Solution
We aim to deliver the best interactive robot companion for children suffering from cerebral palsy to be more independent in fighting against their own conditions through interactive and fun ways.
